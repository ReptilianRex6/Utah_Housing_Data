## Analysis Team

This analysis of Utah housing data is the collective work of the following team members as part of University of Utah's AI Bootcamp by edX:
- Zac Baxter, 
- Ethan Bennett, 
- Ryan Mosher, 
- Stephen Singletary, *a tech enthusiast reskilling to break into data analysis*
- Nathan Tyler, *a well-rounded computer specialist*

## Hypothesis and Questions

### Hypothesis

We believe that the average price of a home in Utah has risen significantly over time due to a combination of rising incomes, population growth, and recent interest rate hikes.

### Questions

To test our hypothesis the analysis will answer:
1. What is the average price of a home in Utah over time?
2. What is the average income in Utah over time?
3. What is the population of Utah over time?
4. How has the Federal interest rate changed over time?
5. What is the relationship between the average price of a home, average income, interest rates, and population?

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis will be obtained from:
- [Fannie Mae](https://developer.fanniemae.com/#/home)
- [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- [U.S. Census Bureau](https://api.census.gov/)

## Methodology

Utilizing modern data analysis tools offered in the Python* programming language, a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) will contain the code to read, clean, organize, and plot the data. The source code file can be run in Jupyter, Jupyter Lab, VS Code with Jupyter Extensions, or Google Colaboratory.

*The Python environment should be setup to include:
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

The analysis will be summarized below in the **[Findings](#findings)** section and a final presentation will be put together using Microsoft PowerPoint.
